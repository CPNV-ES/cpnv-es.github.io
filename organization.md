  * Quote: Uncle Bob Martin:
    
    > What's your job? You might think that your job is to make code work, that's not your job, that's half of your job, and it's the least
    > important half of your job. The more important half of your job is that you must write code that other people can maintain, and use and
    > make work.
    > > If you hand me code that works perfectly but I can't understand it, then as soon as the requirements changes, that code is USELESS.
    > > On the other hand, if you give me code that does not work and I can understant it, I can make it WORK.
    > It is more important that your peers are able to understand the code you write than the computer understands the code you wrote.
