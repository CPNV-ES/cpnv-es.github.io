### Best practices for Git Commit ([source](The seven rules of a great Git commit message))
 1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
 2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
 3. Capitalize the subject line
 4. Do not end the subject line with a period
 5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
 6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
 7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
