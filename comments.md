# Comments

  * All comments must be written in english

> “A comment should state Why and perhaps What (if not clear), never How (that should be clear from the code). This is even more important inside functions, e.g. stating that you're incrementing an index while looping is absolutely useless, rather (if you think you need to) state why you're performing a loop in the first place. The only exception is public classes / methods / fields for auto generated documentation. E.g. stating that your collection uses an array or linked list (single/double) or whatever else helps users of that code know how to make use of it and more importantly how not to.” Irné Barnard on Quora.com
